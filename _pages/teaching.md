# Teaching
### Graduate TA- <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE"> Purdue ECE</a>
Prepare and grade assignments, conduct office hours, and invigilate exams. I engage with students, coordinate the piazza sessions answering questions, and help the instructor manage the class.
* ECE301 Signals and Systems, Fall 2024

### Visiting Instructor- <a href="https://ent.uom.lk/"> ENTC, University of Moratuwa</a>
I assist the lecturers in assignment preparation, evaluations, laboratory work, and invigilation of examinations.
Additionally I conduct reviews on problem sets, and conduct extra sessions when students request additional help or tutoring.
